The solution involves meticulously verifying the import path and component name.

1. **Verify the File Path**: Double-check that the file path in the import statement precisely matches the actual location of the component's file. Pay close attention to upper/lowercase characters.

2. **Check for Typos**: Carefully examine the component's name in both the import statement and the component file itself. Even a minor spelling difference will result in this error.

3. **Clean and Rebuild**: Sometimes, a clean build of the project can resolve lingering issues related to caching.  Try cleaning and rebuilding the project using your appropriate build commands.

4. **Examine the Build Process**: If the error persists after fixing potential typos and paths, scrutinize the build process itself.  Errors earlier in the process might obscure this issue.

```javascript
import MyComponent from './MyComponent'; // Correct import
```

Ensure the case and path are correct.  Consider using relative paths carefully, ensuring there are no typos.
